      CSS-> CASCADING STYLE SHEETS


 It contains properties of various elements in WEBPAGE



 SELECTORS IN CSS:
         it is use to select an element to which we need to apply any APPEARENACE settings

         Note:- we can select one, many element at a time using various type of selectors.


    1) Simple Selectors:-
         a) element selectors
         b) class selectors 
         c) id selectors
    2) Pseudo Selector
    
    3) Multiple Selector      


# Simple selectors
     
     a) element Selector:- its use to select particular tag.
               its also called tag Selector

               eg p{
                  property:value;
               }
               every p tag in html tag will apply this property

       File to be ref:-  index1.html and Style1.css     

    But lets say i have 4 tables and i want two taables with border 4px and 2 tables with 2px
    in such case we need to use class Selector

    b) Class selectors
         
           .className{
               property:value;
           }
    c) ID Selector:
          uique id to target particular element individually


          #idName{
            property:value;
          }

          id is unique

#Pseudo SELECTORS:
     A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected elements). 
     For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.

     to implelment special state of element.


     selector: pseudoclass
     {

     }


 #Multiple SELECTORS
 grouping selector

 table tr td{
    border: 1px solid
 }

 table tr td these are grouped.



 OTHER SELECTORS are aslo there like 
     UINVERSAL
     NESTED
     ATTRIBUTE etc.




3 WAYS TO ADD STYLING 



1)Inline
        <p style="color:red">This is para<p>

2)Internal

         in head tag we can write all css code in styel tag
         <style>
            CSS -code
         </style>   


3)External
        we use eternal css file to write all code and then link this file to html using
        link tag in head tag.
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="path of css file">



SPECIFICTY:-


     which propetry will override other is decided by specififcity

       Order of dominance:-

       tag < class < id < Inline CSS


       but if use !important the that will be picked and specififcity will die 

       but !important is bad practice.
