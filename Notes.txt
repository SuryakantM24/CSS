HTML- SKELETON, DESCRIPTION (WHAT OF WEBPAGE)

CSS - APPEARENACE,STYLING,FORMATTING

      CSS-> CASCADING STYLE SHEETS


 It contains properties of various elements in WEBPAGE



 SELECTORS IN CSS:
         it is use to select an element to which we need to apply any APPEARENACE settings

         Note:- we can select one, many element at a time using various type of selectors.


    1) Simple Selectors:-
         a) element selectors
         b) class selectors 
         c) id selectors
    2) Pseudo Selector
    
    3) Multiple Selector      


# Simple selectors
     
     a) element Selector:- its use to select particular tag.
               its also called tag Selector

               eg p{
                  property:value;
               }
               every p tag in html tag will apply this property

       File to be ref:-  index1.html and Style1.css     

    But lets say i have 4 tables and i want two taables with border 4px and 2 tables with 2px
    in such case we need to use class Selector

    b) Class selectors
         
           .className{
               property:value;
           }
    c) ID Selector:
          uique id to target particular element individually


          #idName{
            property:value;
          }

          id is unique

#Pseudo SELECTORS:
     A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected elements). 
     For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.

     to implelment special state of element.


     selector: pseudoclass
     {

     }


 #Multiple SELECTORS
 grouping selector

 table tr td{
    border: 1px solid
 }

 table tr td these are grouped.



 OTHER SELECTORS are aslo there like 
     UINVERSAL
     NESTED
     ATTRIBUTE etc.




3 WAYS TO ADD STYLING 



1)Inline
        <p style="color:red">This is para<p>

2)Internal

         in head tag we can write all css code in styel tag
         <style>
            CSS -code
         </style>   


3)External
        we use eternal css file to write all code and then link this file to html using
        link tag in head tag.
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="path of css file">



SPECIFICTY:-


     which propetry will override other is decided by specififcity

       Order of dominance:-

       tag < class < id < Inline CSS


       but if use !important the that will be picked and specififcity will die 

       but !important is bad practice.




BOX MODEL IN CSS

The box model is the basic building block of CSS.
According to the box model concept, every element on a page is a rectangular box and may have width, height, padding, borders, and margins.

LECTURE 2//


file refer :- index3.html and Style3.html
CSS GRADIENT:- Shifting Colourr
   types:- linear GRADIENT, radial gradient, conic gradient


a)LINEAR GRADIENT:- down /left/up/right/diagonally
   By Default linear gradient is top to bottom

b) radial gradient:- from any center of circle

c) conicall:-  like top of cone 


CSS-SHADOW EFFECTS

a) text shadow   text-shadow:( horizantal distance)(vertical)(blur) (color)

b) box shadow     box-shadow: 10 px 10 px 10px(blur)
                  by default shadow color is of text Colourr
                  third args can be used as blur affect
                  
                  Multiple shadows can also be given

                  if negative values is given  then direction of shadows can be changed

                  spread-radius attribte:- its 4th value in box-shadow.Positive values will cause the shadow to expand and grow bigger, negative values will cause the shadow to shrink. If not specified, it will be 0 (the shadow will be the same size as the element).



 CSS dimenions:


width 


height

min-height:- if content fits in this then well and good else if its getting out then it div size will grow.

min-width:-

max-width:

max-height: content aftr this height will 

     we can handle this overflow using overflow attributes.

similar for max and min width



overflow:-  visible( always visible)
            hidden (extra content hidden)
            scroll( scrolling)
            auto (again scorll aur visisble mix depending on content size)



overflow is shorthand propetry of overflow-x and overflow-y

• With transform property you can use following methodsL=
• translate
• rotated
• scaleX
. scaleY
. scaled 
. skewx 
. skewY
